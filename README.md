#  Snake Game AI with Q-Learning

A classic Snake game where the snake learns to play using **Reinforcement Learning** via **Q-Learning**. This project visualizes the training and inference of an AI agent as it learns to collect food and avoid walls or self-collisions.

##  Reinforcement Learning Setup

| Element      | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **State**    | Relative direction to food, dangers around, current direction |
| **Actions**  | Up, Down, Left, Right                      |
| **Reward**   | +10 for eating food, -10 for dying, -0.1 per move |
| **Q-table**  | Dictionary mapping states to action values |
| **Policy**   | Îµ-greedy (exploration vs exploitation)     |
